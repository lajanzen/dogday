## Installing / Getting started

First, install dependencies: `npm install`

In the project directory, you can then run:

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

`npm start` : Runs the server in production mode and serve production bundle from npm run build

`npm run server:dev` : Runs the server in development mode.

`npm run client:dev` : Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 (default PORT) to view it in the browser.
The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.
